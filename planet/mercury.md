# About
Located in the [Sun Star System](/star-system/sun-star-system), Mercury is the first planet in the barycenter orbit of Sun. It is the smallest true planet in our System and also holds the shortest orbit around the Sun at 87.97 days.

Mercury does not have an atmosphere so the temperature changes dramatically based on whether a given location is facing Sun.
