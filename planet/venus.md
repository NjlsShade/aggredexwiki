# About
Located in the [Sun Star System](/star-system/sun-star-system), Venus is the second planet in the barycenter orbit of Sun. It has a 224.7-day orbit around the Sun and holds the longest rotation period of any planet in the Sun System.

Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets and does not have any natural satellites.

The temperature on Venus stays mostly consistent, even between night and day due to its dense greenhouse atmosphere. In addition, the lack of significant tilt in the planet causes only slight temperature variations from the equator to the poles.
