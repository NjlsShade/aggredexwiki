<!-- TITLE: Planet Nine -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Planet Nine -->

# About
Around 10 times the mass of Earth and 20 times farther from the sun than Neptune, Planet Nine is a hypothetical object in our soler system that would take the status of our ninth planet if it is indeed out there.

The existence of this suggested ninth planet is purely based on mathematic evidence and has never been detected in real world measurements, with it being placed at over 60AU from the sun, it is possible we wont find any solid proof of its being any time soon.
