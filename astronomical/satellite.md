# About
A celestial satellite is a naturally occurring body that orbits a planet. Many satellites are large enough and hold a consistent orbit which permits them the status of a moon.

Though the term is often used to regard an artificial object orbiting a planet, Earth's Moon is indeed a natural satellite, and all other planetary moons also yield this status.
