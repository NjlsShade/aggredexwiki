# About
In the Stellar Index, "Origin" is used sometimes to refer to our home Star System's [barycenter](/mathematics/measurement/barycenter).

Currently we only have one known inhabited Star System so the term is very specific, however, it can be used to refer to any established civilization's own Star System properties.
